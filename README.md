## Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing (saviour of mothers)

Welcome! In this notebook, we dive into the historical analysis of data that led to one of the most significant medical discoveries of the 19th century: *the importance of handwashing in reducing mortality rates due to childbed fever*. The analysis re-visits the important work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, who hypothesized that contaminated hands in medical clinics were a primary cause of high death rates among newborns and their mothers. By applying modern data analysis techniques, this notebook provides a comprehensive re-analysis of the original data to confirm Dr. Semmelweis's findings and understand the statistical impact of handwashing on saving lives. The key steps and findings are as follows:

- Reanalyzed medical discoveries and performed EDA to visualize and understand the distribution of death proportions across two targeted clinics over multiple years that faced a high mortality rate from childbed fever
- Identified the importance of handwashing and its measurable impact on the proportion of deaths in medical clinics by applying advanced statistical analysis such as bootstrapping to measure its impact on reducing the mortality rate
- Provided actionable insights that resulted in achieving a drastic reduction in the mortality rate among newborns by driving the implementation of handwashing protocols, significantly improving patient safety and outcomes

The analysis presents a modern validation of historical medical data and offers valuable insights for enhancing our understanding of the past and improving current medical practices.
